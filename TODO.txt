1) Make a display on the screen
2) Build sprite database
3) Conceptualize inputs (json files, configs, etc.)

NEXT
1) Handle single-loading classes with inheritence
2) Make player and enable moving on screen
3) enable player collisions with obstacles

Don't worry about perfect implementation
Get quick-and-dirty, polish it up a bit, then move on

### 12-17
Make comprehensive NavMesh system
-> prevent recomputing of obstacles
-> implement LOS algorithms (dirty, then chunky)
Make trigger system
-> edit in level editor, export to pynamo engine

## 12-24
Merry Christmas Eve. I'm struggling to make progress, and I need to stop spinning my wheels about this whole process

Here's some tasks I can try to accomplish:
1) Finish the inverse kinematics creature
 a) implement joint constraints
 b) obstacle avoidance
 c) grab positions
  -> involves LOS detection for grab positions
  -> optimal solution would involve computing a navmesh, not sure if that's needed, though, 
     if I do a chunk-based solution
 d) collisions/arms stopped by obstacles 
  -> I feel like this can be solved with gradient descent
 e) multiple arms, centralized intelligence, decision-making
 f) art and making it look good
 - That in and of itself is a monumental task, but doable

2) Improve the level editor
 a) Add support for another tileset
 b) add asset support
 c) triggers
  -> display name on hover
  -> build description box
  -> show list of current triggers, jump-to feature
 d) clean up save/load feature with easygui
  -> allow for cleaner load/save options
 e) enable layer selection (select and move tiles across the screen)
 f) keyboard shortcuts?
 - Not all of these tasks are crucial, but they'd make level design so much more 
   effecient and a whole lot easier

3) Art, VFX/SFX, and Sound Design
 a) need to create character art
  -> Brood mother (only one for now)
 b) make entities
  -> Spiders (brood mother, guards, player)
  -> ants (queen, worker/drone, fire ants, armored)
 c) environment design
 d) second tileset
  -> also need a LOT more assets; Castle Darkheart felt far too empty
 e) title theme/intro design

4) Gameplay
 a) create MVP
  -> who is the protagonist?
  -> how do they move? attack? interact with objects?
  -> what are their special abilities
 b) make dialogue boxes
 c) polish
  -> dynamic grass
  -> vines
  -> spiderwebs (verlet integration)
  -> particle effects (pheremone, impacts/dust, leaves)

The workflow, then, should be as follows:
1) character creation, implementation, and design
-> fix IK creatures
 i) make los culling for unreachable positions
 ii) implement chunk-based reach
 iii) coordinate arms within a creature
 iv) build character controls (jumping, web-slinging)
 v) character art

If I can move the character inside the world, even just a rough draft, 
before the new year, that will be a win

## 12-25
Merry Christmas

I made a rudimentary IK movement algorithm. It's pretty ugly, and relies on the Level Editor; future iterations will need to incorporate
better coding and implementation

I know how to accomplish tasks with joint constraints, and obstacle avoidance is accomplishable with gradient-descent approaches

Given how janky the system will be, do I want the player to be bound by a physics engine?
Rain World saw success with that, but again, it was a stand-alone artistic piece
My audience is primarily the Night of the Arts conference; needs to be digestible and easily playable
I could have it be control-driven, with IK art. That should be a good combination of art and math to sustain the illusion

Task list
- fix autotile with blank centers
-> looks a little janky, could be cleaned up a lot

August 2nd, 2025
-> just trying to have obstacles render appropriately
-> right now, I'm only handling collisions for obstacles on screen
-> I'd like to make that more specific to the entities in the vicinity

I'm sick of fighting the rect/pos battle; I just want to work with one (preferrably just rect)

So what I managed to do today was pretty neat:
> consolidated player and enemies under a single physics entity
> removed a lot of duplicate code
