Ideas for Level Editor 2:

I understand that this library is a quick-and-dirty implementation IOT make progress on my upcoming game, 
Castle Darkheart. However, for future-proofing, scalability, and flexibility, I need to improve the quality of 
the code greatly

Generic:
> Isolate heavy-lifting functions into their own areas to free up the core library, making it more flexible
and user-friendly
> Use css-like scripts to eliminate unnecessary and redundant cosmetic work
> Build a config file to instantiate world values (like chunk size)
> Build a library "pynamap" or some sh*t to make a normal map with incredibly simple and extensible functionality

Specific:
> Instead of using mouse.get_pressed(), use pygame mouse events to detect unique presses, avoiding
the entire 'just pressed' conundrum
> Allow for noise integration for maps and stuff
