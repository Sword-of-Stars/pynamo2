Maybe create a 'batch' class to handle batches of objects (like images or selectables)
to make handling large amounts of data easier and to clean up the respective region
classes

Yeah, just generally clean up the region classes

Potentially add the possibility for animation later?

Selection still feels crappy, though the selectable objects help somewhat

I need to remember this doesn't require perfection, just needs to be efficient enough

The chunk size appears locked to the screen, hmm.
The items are being placed in improper chunk ID locations. For instance, [3,-1]

Need to figure out how to implement:
1) decor (placement, )
2) item descriptions
3)
