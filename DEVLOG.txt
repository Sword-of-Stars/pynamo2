It's been quite a while since last we left our heroes. But now, here we are, ready to get right back at It

I did so much in this update that it's virtually impossible to document it all. My vision for this project

Can't believe I haven't worked on this seriously in a while. I really just want to make something cool.

3) Clean up asset manager; currently, it's really messy
4) Make compatible with top-down perspective
5) Cull unneeded inputs
